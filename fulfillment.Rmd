A quote by Dag Hammarskjold, a Swedish economist and diplomat who served as the second Secretary-General of the United Nations from April 1953 until his death in a plane crash in September 1961 at the age of 56.

*It is more noble to give yourself completely to one individual than to labor diligently for the salvation of the masses.*

Perhaps he wrote another that might have said,

*It is far more satisfying and liberating to labor for the fulfillment of a soul -- oneself, than to labor diligently to satisfy expectations of masses.*

The world will meet its needs one way another.

However, we only have a finite time to fulfill needs of oneself and possibly needs of those around us.
